### PIC 16B: Blog Post 2 (Homework/Project Assignment)

Determining various filmography that shares actors with my favorite filmography ("Pride and Prejudice (2005)"). The main idea is that if my favorite filmography has the same actors as another filmography (let this filmography be X), then it is likely that I would also enjoy filmography X.  This post will consist of two parts. In the first part, I'll write a webscraper to determine shared actors on IMDB. The second part involves using the results from me webscraper to make recommendations.
